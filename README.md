Macro‑Driven, Climate‑Aware, Regime‑Switching Volatility Forecasting for NG1 Futures

A research‑grade, production‑ready volatility forecasting framework for NYMEX Natural Gas front‑month futures (NG1).
This project integrates weather extremes, climate risk indicators, regime‑switching dynamics, econometric volatility models, machine learning benchmarks, and hybrid ensembles into a single reproducible pipeline.

The goal is not to crown a single “best” model, but to systematically evaluate when and why different volatility mechanisms dominate—especially under climate stress, structural breaks, and regime shifts.

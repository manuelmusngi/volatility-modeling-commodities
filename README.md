📘 Project Summary
Natural Gas Volatility Modeling with GARCH‑Family, Long‑Memory, MIDAS, and Regime‑Switching Frameworks

This project implements a complete, modular, end‑to‑end research framework for modeling and forecasting natural gas price volatility using advanced econometric and machine‑learning methods. The architecture integrates long‑memory GARCH models, asymmetric power models, macro‑driven MIDAS components, regime‑switching volatility, and ML benchmarks—reflecting the evolution of volatility modeling in both academic literature and practitioner workflows.

The codebase is structured for reproducible research, systematic experimentation, and production‑grade extensibility, making it suitable for quantitative researchers, energy analysts, and algorithmic trading teams.

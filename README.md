Macro‑Driven, Climate‑Aware, Regime‑Switching Volatility Forecasting for NG1 Futures

A research‑grade, production‑ready volatility forecasting framework for NYMEX Natural Gas front‑month futures (NG1).
This project integrates weather extremes, climate risk indicators, regime‑switching dynamics, econometric volatility models, machine learning benchmarks, and hybrid ensembles into a single reproducible pipeline.

The goal is not to crown a single “best” model, but to systematically evaluate when and why different volatility mechanisms dominate—especially under climate stress, structural breaks, and regime shifts.

🎯 Target Market

- Instrument: Natural Gas Front‑Month Futures (NG1)

- Frequency: Daily

- Primary Outputs:

   - Conditional variance forecasts

   - Realized volatility proxy forecasts

   - Optional VaR / ES extensions

🧠 Research Motivation

- Natural gas volatility is uniquely sensitive to:

- Extreme weather events

- Climate‑related disasters

- Policy uncertainty

- Structural breaks and regime shifts

This repository operationalizes insights from recent literature:

- Weather‑augmented GARCH‑MIDAS improves NG volatility forecasts.

- Climate disaster frequency is a robust long‑run volatility driver.

- Energy volatility exhibits regime‑dependent persistence.

- Machine learning models outperform out‑of‑sample, but exhibit systematic bias.

- Hybrid models mitigate weaknesses of both econometric and ML approaches.
